## SkillSprint



**SkillSprint** is a global company specializing in organizing workshops, seminars, and webinars across various industries.

The company hosts a diverse array of events, ranging from small, niche workshops to large-scale international conferences. These events bring together experts, professionals, and enthusiasts from around the world.

As **SkillSprint** continues to grow, managing the logistical details of these events—such as tracking speakers, scheduling sessions, and handling attendee registrations—has become increasingly challenging.

That's why SkillSprint requires a database system that streamlines event management and secures data integrity. This system enables the company to efficiently organize its events, monitor speakers, track attendee registrations, and gather feedback.

**SkillSprint** is also exploring potential partnerships with local businesses to enhance the attendee experience. However, their immediate priority is leveraging collected data to gain meaningful insights into their operations. They aim to understand speaker popularity, attendance trends, and feedback to improve future events and make data-driven decisions.
